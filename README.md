# Coffee Scraper
Ever have an item you want to buy but it just about never goes on sale? I ran into this issue with a coffee mug. After consistently checking the price for several weeks, I decided to build a web scraper to do it for me. The web scraper is written in Python and uses Selenium along with a Chrome driver to load the items webpage. The price is analyzed, and if on sale, an email is sent to you informing you of the new price.
